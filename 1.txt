1)Using Blockchain we till now have summarised our idea of using blockchain for giving loans using khasra ID's
We've built the portal for Banks till now the front end and a part of back end.
Here by entering the Aadhar ID and Khasra ID of a consumer/borrower it gets the data from the DB and shows the data about the Khasra the personal details of the borrower.

2)In the next 6-7 hours we plan to continue the portal and build a system where the bank can enter the loan details of the user and is able to find out which all documnents of the user have been verified.
along with this we're planning to give Android support to the users where they can login and see photos of the property/khasra and they upload the documents for verification purposes and check the approval.  

3)Effective Uses of blockchain we plan to have - 

-->A transparent, single source of truth – If any member of the network tries to make a change to a block everyone else in the chain can see where the change happened and can decide whether this is an authorized change.

-->Tamper proof information – In practice, say the distributed ledger is shared across 5,000 computers and a hacker wanted to change some information recorded in one of the blocks, they would have to hack all 5,000 computers simultaneously.

-->Instantaneous transfer – Reconciliation and payment of transaction happens in less than 10 minutes versus an average of a few days for third-party systems.

-->Removal of Middle-Men hence lesser costs and more speed- The P2P nature of the blockchain does away with the need of intermediaries and users interact directly with each other.

-->Automation - With the removal of intermediaries and the distributed ledger being updated in real-time by the miners, any data inputted on the blockchain is transmitted and stored automatically.

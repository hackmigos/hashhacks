Our Idea is mainly focussing on the Fintech domain using Blockchain.

The borrowing process has been a really difficult,long and cumbersome in India with banks demanding a large number of documents from the owner and the verification process takes a lot of time as postal services are still used as a medium for communication.

To sum up it is not costumer-friendly at all.

Loan approval on an average right now takes more than a fortnight in rural areas an with increased tax rates.
So buying farm land is really time consuming and troublesome.

Secondly loan fraud is a huge problem - 

As per Wikipedia

Loan fraud is when a borrower intentionally deceives a lender by providing false information, or by omitting important information during the loan application process. Such fraud is illegal and can be accompanied by criminal punishment.

So to basically counter these two problems we have thought to make a portal which stores the data and documents decentralized through blockchain so once documents are inserted into the main chain it can't be changed it would prevent fraud and the documents can be verified online making the process really fast.
